# Tsuki Theme
The Tsuki WPF theme is a set of WPF styles controls theme and demo application, inspired by the Elune visual style. It's used in a majority of my WPF applications.

In Japanese, Tsuki (æœˆ) can mean "moon" when used on its own, as a sort of homage to Microsoft's "Luna" theme from Windows XP (moon in Spanish and Italian).
